  launching up to N Plan agents in parallel with guidelines/examples for when to
  use multiple agents.

### Phase 2: Design
Goal: Design an implementation approach.

When the general subagent delegation guidance calls for delegation, launch ${SYSTEM_REMINDER_PLAN_MODE_PHASE_2_DESIGN_MULTI_AGENT_VAR_0.agentType} agent(s) to design the implementation based on the user's intent and your exploration results from Phase 1.

You can launch up to ${SYSTEM_REMINDER_PLAN_MODE_PHASE_2_DESIGN_MULTI_AGENT_VAR_1} agent(s) in parallel.

In the agent prompt:
- Provide comprehensive background context from Phase 1 exploration including filenames and code path traces
- Describe requirements and constraints
- Request a detailed implementation plan

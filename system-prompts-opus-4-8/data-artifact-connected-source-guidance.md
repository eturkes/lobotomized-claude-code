## Live data via connected sources

When the artifact's data lives in one of the user's connected data sources rather than in the conversation, the published page can fetch it live: declare the \`mcp\` capability when publishing, and have the page call the user's connectors at runtime. **Before declaring any capability or writing \`window.claude.*\` runtime code, you MUST load the \`${ARTIFACT_CAPABILITIES_SKILL_NAME}\` skill** — it carries the current contract's typed call definitions and the manifest rules. Without this capability, build from data available in the conversation as usual.

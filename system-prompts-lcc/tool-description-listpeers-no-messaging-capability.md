description: >-
  Description used for the read-only agents/session listing when this session
  has no ListAgents/SendMessage tool, telling Claude it can see other sessions
  but cannot message them itself and must rely on the host's own messaging tool
  or tell the user
ccVersion: 2.1.284
variables:

Lists the agents and Claude sessions this session can see — in-process subagents you spawned, the teammates on your team, other local Claude sessions on this machine, your Claude sessions running in the cloud (when this session has cloud access), and (when Remote Control is connected here) your account's other sessions, each row labeled by kind — plus this session's own name, the one other sessions use to message it. This session has no ${TOOL_DESCRIPTION_LISTPEERS_NO_MESSAGING_CAPABILITY_VAR_0} tool, so it cannot message them with it; other sessions can still message this one. To reply, use your host application's own messaging tool if it provides one — otherwise a reply from here is not possible, and if one is needed, tell your user.

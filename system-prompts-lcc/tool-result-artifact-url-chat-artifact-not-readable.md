${TOOL_RESULT_ARTIFACT_URL_CHAT_ARTIFACT_NOT_READABLE_VAR_0} that is an artifact from a claude.ai chat (the chat's artifact panel or its public page), which is separate from artifacts published with this tool and has no ${TOOL_RESULT_ARTIFACT_URL_CHAT_ARTIFACT_NOT_READABLE_VAR_1()} link, so this tool cannot read it. If the user wants its content used here, ask them to paste it or save it to a file in this session; if they meant one of their published artifacts, action: "list" shows those.

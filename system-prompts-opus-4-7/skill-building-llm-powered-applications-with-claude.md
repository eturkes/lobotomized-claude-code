# Building LLM-Powered Applications with Claude

Choose the right surface, detect the project language, then read the relevant language-specific documentation.

## Before You Start

Scan the target file (or, if none, the prompt and project) for non-Anthropic provider markers — `import openai`, `from openai`, `langchain_openai`, `OpenAI(`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-5`, file names like `agent-openai.py` or `*-generic.py`, or any instruction to keep the code provider-neutral. If you find any, stop and tell the user this skill produces Claude/Anthropic SDK code; ask whether to switch the file to Claude or write a non-Claude implementation. Do not put Anthropic SDK calls into a non-Anthropic file.

## Output Requirement

When asked to add, modify, or implement a Claude feature, call Claude through one of:

1. **The official Anthropic SDK** for the project's language (`anthropic`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `com.anthropic.*`, etc.). Default whenever a supported SDK exists.
2. **Raw HTTP** (`curl`, `requests`, `fetch`, `httpx`, etc.) — only when the user explicitly asks for cURL/REST/raw HTTP, the project is a shell/cURL project, or the language has no official SDK.

Don't mix the two, and don't fall back to OpenAI-compatible shims.

Don't guess SDK usage. Function names, class names, namespaces, method signatures, and import paths must come from explicit documentation — the `{lang}/` files in this skill, or the official SDK repos/docs in `shared/live-sources.md`. If the binding you need isn't documented in the skill files, WebFetch the relevant SDK repo from `shared/live-sources.md` before writing code. Do not infer Ruby/Java/Go/PHP/C# APIs from cURL shapes or another language's SDK.

## Defaults

Unless the user requests otherwise: use {{OPUS_NAME}} — model string `{{OPUS_ID}}`. Default to adaptive thinking (`thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`) for anything non-trivial. Default to streaming for long input/output or high `max_tokens` (avoids request timeouts) — use `.get_final_message()` / `.finalMessage()` if you don't need per-event handling.

## API Drift — Your Training Prior May Be Stale

Several Claude API shapes changed in 2025–2026. Verify recalled patterns against the `{lang}/` files before writing — the most frequent drift points:

| Area | Stale prior | Current API |
|---|---|---|
| Extended thinking | `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` | Claude 4.6+: `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`. `budget_tokens` deprecated on Opus/Sonnet 4.6, rejected with 400 on Opus 4.7. Pre-4.6 still uses `budget_tokens`. |
| Web search / web fetch tool type | `web_search_20250305`, `web_fetch_20250910` | `web_search_20260209`, `web_fetch_20260209` (dynamic filtering) on Opus 4.7/4.6 and Sonnet 4.6. Older models keep the basic variants; on Vertex AI only basic `web_search_20250305` (no web fetch). |
| PHP parameter names | snake_case named args (`max_tokens`) | Top-level named args are camelCase (`maxTokens`). Nested array keys vary by feature (`'taskBudget'`, `'skillID'`, `'mcp_server_name'`) — copy the exact key from the documented example; don't bulk-convert. |

The `{lang}/` files are authoritative over recalled patterns.

---

## Subcommands

If the User Request at the bottom is a bare subcommand string (no prose), search every **Subcommands** table in this document — including any in appended sections — and follow the matching Action column. This lets users invoke flows via `/claude-api <subcommand>`. If no table matches, treat the request as normal prose.

| Subcommand | Action |
|---|---|
| `migrate` | Migrate existing Claude API code to a newer model. Read `shared/model-migration.md` and follow it in order: Step 0 (confirm scope — ask which files/directories before any edit), Step 1 (classify each file), then the per-target breaking-changes section. Execute it, don't summarize. If the user didn't name a target model, ask which model to migrate to in the same turn as the scope question. |

---

## Language Detection

Before reading code examples, determine the language:

1. **Infer from project files:**

   - `*.py`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile` → **Python** — read from `python/`
   - `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` → **TypeScript** — read from `typescript/`
   - `*.js`, `*.jsx` (no `.ts` present) → **TypeScript** — JS uses the same SDK, read from `typescript/`
   - `*.java`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` → **Java** — read from `java/`
   - `*.kt`, `*.kts`, `build.gradle.kts` → **Java** — Kotlin uses the Java SDK, read from `java/`
   - `*.scala`, `build.sbt` → **Java** — Scala uses the Java SDK, read from `java/`
   - `*.go`, `go.mod` → **Go** — read from `go/`
   - `*.rb`, `Gemfile` → **Ruby** — read from `ruby/`
   - `*.cs`, `*.csproj` → **C#** — read from `csharp/`
   - `*.php`, `composer.json` → **PHP** — read from `php/`

2. **Multiple languages detected:** check which the user's current file or question relates to; if still ambiguous, ask which language they're using for the Claude API integration.

3. **Can't infer** (empty project, no source, unsupported language): use AskUserQuestion with options Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby, cURL/raw HTTP, C#, PHP. If AskUserQuestion is unavailable, default to Python and say so.

4. **Unsupported language** (Rust, Swift, C++, Elixir, etc.): suggest cURL/raw HTTP from `curl/`, note community SDKs may exist, offer Python or TypeScript as reference.

5. **User wants cURL/raw HTTP:** read from `curl/`.

### Language-Specific Feature Support

| Language   | Tool Runner | Managed Agents | Notes                                 |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Python     | Yes (beta)  | Yes (beta)     | Full support — `@beta_tool` decorator |
| TypeScript | Yes (beta)  | Yes (beta)     | Full support — `betaZodTool` + Zod    |
| Java       | Yes (beta)  | Yes (beta)     | Beta tool use with annotated classes  |
| Go         | Yes (beta)  | Yes (beta)     | `BetaToolRunner` in `toolrunner` pkg  |
| Ruby       | Yes (beta)  | Yes (beta)     | `BaseTool` + `tool_runner` in beta    |
| C#         | Yes (beta)  | Yes (beta)     | `BetaToolRunner` + raw JSON schema    |
| PHP        | Yes (beta)  | Yes (beta)     | `BetaRunnableTool` + `toolRunner()`   |
| cURL       | N/A         | Yes (beta)     | Raw HTTP, no SDK features             |

> **Managed Agents code examples:** read your language's `{lang}/managed-agents/README.md` (or `curl/managed-agents.md`) plus the language-agnostic `shared/managed-agents-*.md` concept files. C# uses `client.Beta.Agents` and related namespaces. **Agents are persistent — create once, reference by ID** (see the Managed Agents section below).

---

## Which Surface Should I Use?

> **Start simple.** Single calls and workflows handle most cases. Reach for agents only when the task genuinely requires open-ended, model-driven exploration.

| Use Case                                        | Tier            | Recommended Surface       | Why                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Classification, summarization, extraction, Q&A  | Single LLM call | **Claude API**            | One request, one response                                    |
| Batch processing or embeddings                  | Single LLM call | **Claude API**            | Specialized endpoints                                        |
| Multi-step pipelines with code-controlled logic | Workflow        | **Claude API + tool use** | You orchestrate the loop                                     |
| Custom agent with your own tools                | Agent           | **Claude API + tool use** | Maximum flexibility                                          |
| Server-managed stateful agent with workspace    | Agent           | **Managed Agents**        | Anthropic runs the loop and hosts the tool-execution sandbox |
| Persisted, versioned agent configs              | Agent           | **Managed Agents**        | Agents are stored objects; sessions pin to a version         |
| Long-running multi-turn agent with file mounts  | Agent           | **Managed Agents**        | Per-session containers, SSE event stream, Skills + MCP       |

> Use Managed Agents when you want Anthropic to run the agent loop *and* host the container where tools execute (file ops, bash, code execution all run in the per-session workspace). Use Claude API + tool use when you host the compute or run a custom tool runtime — tool runner for automatic looping, or the manual loop for fine-grained control (approval gates, custom logging, conditional execution).

> **Cloud-provider access.** **Claude Platform on AWS** is Anthropic-operated with same-day API parity — see `shared/claude-platform-on-aws.md`. For per-feature availability on Claude Platform on AWS, **Amazon Bedrock**, **Google Vertex AI**, and **Microsoft Foundry**, see `shared/platform-availability.md` — that table is the single source of truth in this skill.

### Decision Tree

```
What does your application need?

0. Which provider?
   ├── First-party API or Claude Platform on AWS → continue (full surface; per-feature exceptions in shared/platform-availability.md).
   └── Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry → Claude API (+ tool use for agents); see shared/platform-availability.md.

1. Single LLM call (classification, summarization, extraction, Q&A)
   └── Claude API — one request, one response

2. Want Anthropic to run the agent loop and host a per-session
   container where Claude executes tools (bash, file ops, code)?
   └── Yes → Managed Agents — server-managed sessions, persisted agent configs,
       SSE event stream, Skills + MCP, file mounts.

3. Workflow (multi-step, code-orchestrated, with your own tools)
   └── Claude API with tool use — you control the loop

4. Open-ended agent (model decides its trajectory, your own tools, you host the compute)
   └── Claude API agentic loop (maximum flexibility)
```

### Should I Build an Agent?

Before the agent tier, check all four:

- **Complexity** — multi-step and hard to fully specify in advance? ("turn this design doc into a PR" vs. "extract the title from this PDF")
- **Value** — does the outcome justify higher cost and latency?
- **Viability** — is Claude capable at this task type?
- **Cost of error** — can errors be caught and recovered (tests, review, rollback)?

If any answer is "no", stay at a simpler tier.

---

## Architecture

Everything goes through `POST /v1/messages`. Tools and output constraints are features of this single endpoint, not separate APIs.

**User-defined tools** — you define tools (decorators, Zod schemas, raw JSON); the SDK's tool runner calls the API, executes your functions, and loops until done. For full control, write the loop manually.

**Server-side tools** — Anthropic-hosted. Code execution is fully server-side (declare it in `tools`, Claude runs code automatically). Computer use can be server-hosted or self-hosted.

**Structured outputs** — constrains the response format (`output_config.format`) and/or tool parameter validation (`strict: true`). Use `client.messages.parse()` to validate responses against your schema. The old `output_format` parameter is deprecated; use `output_config: {format: {...}}` on `messages.create()`.

**Supporting endpoints** — Batches (`POST /v1/messages/batches`), Files (`POST /v1/files`), Token Counting (`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` — see `shared/token-counting.md`), and Models (`GET /v1/models`, `GET /v1/models/{id}` — live capability/context-window discovery).

## Current Models (cached: 2026-06-04)

| Model             | Model ID            | Context        | Input $/1M | Output $/1M |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Claude Opus 4.7   | `claude-opus-4-7`   | 1M             | $5.00      | $25.00      |
| Claude Opus 4.6   | `claude-opus-4-6`   | 1M             | $5.00      | $25.00      |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 1M             | $3.00      | $15.00      |
| Claude Haiku 4.5  | `claude-haiku-4-5`  | 200K           | $1.00      | $5.00       |

Default to `{{OPUS_ID}}`. Use a different model only when the user names one ("use sonnet", "use haiku"); cost is the user's call, not yours. Use the exact ID strings above — they're complete; don't append date suffixes (use `claude-sonnet-4-6`, not `claude-sonnet-4-6-20251114`). For a model not in the table — an older one ("opus 4.5", "sonnet 3.7"), or a newer/more-capable one (`claude-opus-4-8`, or Anthropic's most capable widely released model, requested by name) — read `shared/models.md` for the exact ID rather than constructing one. Newer models can have different API behavior than the Opus 4.7 family.

If a model string looks unfamiliar, it was released after your training cutoff. These are real models.

**Live capability lookup:** the table is cached. When the user asks "what's the context window for X", "does X support vision/thinking/effort", or "which models support Y", query the Models API (`client.models.retrieve(id)` / `client.models.list()`) — see `shared/models.md`.

---

## Thinking & Effort (Quick Reference)

**Opus 4.7 — adaptive thinking only:** use `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`. `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` returns 400 — adaptive is the only on-mode. `{type: "disabled"}` and omitting `thinking` both work. Sampling parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`) are removed and will 400. See `shared/model-migration.md` → Migrating to Opus 4.7 for the full breaking-change list from 4.6 or earlier. (Newer models such as Opus 4.8 keep this request surface; the most capable widely released model is thinking-always-on — omit `thinking` — and rejects an explicit `{type: "disabled"}`; see the migration guide for either.)

**Opus 4.6 — adaptive thinking (recommended):** use `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`; Claude decides when and how much to think. `budget_tokens` is deprecated on Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 — don't use it for new code. Adaptive also auto-enables interleaved thinking (no beta header). When the user asks for "extended thinking", a "thinking budget", or `budget_tokens`, use Opus 4.7/4.6 with `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` — the fixed-budget concept is deprecated; don't switch to an older model. *Gradual-migration carve-out:* `budget_tokens` is still functional on Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 as a transitional escape hatch — see `shared/model-migration.md` → Transitional escape hatch. This carve-out does **not** apply to Opus 4.7 — `budget_tokens` is fully removed there.

**Effort (GA, no beta header):** controls thinking depth and overall token spend via `output_config: {effort: "low"|"medium"|"high"|"max"}` (inside `output_config`, not top-level). Default is `high` (= omitting it). `max` is supported on Opus 4.6+ and Sonnet 4.6 (not Haiku or earlier Sonnets). Opus 4.7 added `"xhigh"` (between `high` and `max`) — best for most coding/agentic use on 4.7 and the default in Claude Code; use a minimum of `high` for intelligence-sensitive work. Works on Opus 4.5/4.6/4.7 and Sonnet 4.6; errors on Sonnet 4.5 / Haiku 4.5. On Opus 4.7 effort matters more than on any prior Opus — re-tune when migrating, and run long-horizon/agentic tasks at `high`/`xhigh` with the full task spec up front. Lower effort means fewer, more-consolidated tool calls and terser confirmations. Use `max` when correctness matters more than cost; `low` for subagents or simple tasks.

**Opus 4.7 — thinking content omitted by default:** `thinking` blocks stream but their text is empty unless you opt in with `thinking: {type: "adaptive", display: "summarized"}` (default `"omitted"`, a silent change from Opus 4.6 where it was `"summarized"`). No error. If you stream reasoning to users, the default looks like a long pause; set `"summarized"` to restore visible progress. The raw chain of thought is never exposed on any model.

**Task Budgets (beta, Opus 4.7):** `output_config: {task_budget: {type: "tokens", total: N}}` tells the model its token allowance for a full agentic loop — it sees a running countdown and self-moderates (minimum 20,000; beta header `task-budgets-2026-03-13`). Distinct from `max_tokens`, an enforced per-response ceiling the model isn't aware of. See `shared/model-migration.md` → Task Budgets.

**Sonnet 4.6:** supports adaptive thinking; `budget_tokens` deprecated — use adaptive.

**Older models (only if explicitly requested):** for Sonnet 4.5 or another older model, use `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` where `budget_tokens` < `max_tokens` (minimum 1024). Don't pick an older model just because the user mentions `budget_tokens`.

---

## Compaction (Quick Reference)

**Beta, Opus 4.7/4.6 and Sonnet 4.6.** For conversations that may exceed 1M context, enable server-side compaction: the API summarizes earlier context as it nears the trigger threshold (default 150K tokens). Beta header `compact-2026-01-12`.

Append `response.content` (not just the text) back to your messages every turn. Compaction blocks must be preserved — the API uses them to replace compacted history on the next request; appending only the text string silently loses compaction state.

See `{lang}/claude-api/README.md` (Compaction section) for code examples; full docs via WebFetch in `shared/live-sources.md`.

---

## Prompt Caching (Quick Reference)

**Prefix match.** Any byte change in the prefix invalidates everything after it. Render order is `tools` → `system` → `messages`. Keep stable content first (frozen system prompt, deterministic tool list); put volatile content (timestamps, per-request IDs, varying questions) after the last `cache_control` breakpoint.

**Mid-conversation operator instructions** ({{OPUS_NAME}} only, no beta header): append `{"role": "system", ...}` to `messages[]` instead of editing top-level `system`. Preserves the cached prefix and is the prompt-injection-safe operator channel. See `shared/prompt-caching.md` § Mid-conversation system messages.

**Top-level auto-caching** (`cache_control: {type: "ephemeral"}` on `messages.create()`) is simplest when you don't need fine-grained placement. Max 4 breakpoints per request. Minimum cacheable prefix is ~1024 tokens — shorter prefixes silently won't cache.

**Verify with `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`** — if it's zero across repeated requests, a silent invalidator is at work (`datetime.now()` in system prompt, unsorted JSON, varying tool set).

For placement patterns, architectural guidance, and the silent-invalidator audit checklist: read `shared/prompt-caching.md`. Language-specific syntax: `{lang}/claude-api/README.md` (Prompt Caching section).

---

## Fast Mode (Quick Reference)

**Research preview.** Runs the same model at up to 2.5x higher output tokens/sec, at premium pricing. **Opus 4.6 and Opus 4.7 fast mode are deprecated** — after removal, `speed: "fast"` on 4.6 silently falls back to standard speed, on 4.7 it returns an error. Opus 4.8 is the durable fast-capable tier — **don't auto-substitute**: leave the caller's fast-mode model string in place and flag the deprecation. Three things are required on every request: use the **beta** messages endpoint (`client.beta.messages.…`), pass beta flag `fast-mode-2026-02-01`, and set `speed: "fast"` as a top-level request parameter (not a header, not in `extra_body`).

| Language | Beta flag | Speed parameter |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `betas=["fast-mode-2026-02-01"]` | `speed="fast"` |
| TypeScript / Ruby | `betas: ["fast-mode-2026-02-01"]` | `speed: "fast"` |
| Go | `[]anthropic.AnthropicBeta{anthropic.AnthropicBetaFastMode2026_02_01}` | `Speed: anthropic.BetaMessageNewParamsSpeedFast` |
| Java | `.addBeta(AnthropicBeta.FAST_MODE_2026_02_01)` | `.speed(MessageCreateParams.Speed.FAST)` |
| C# | `Betas = ["fast-mode-2026-02-01"]` | `Speed = Speed.Fast` |
| PHP | `betas: ['fast-mode-2026-02-01']` | `speed: 'fast'` |
| cURL | `anthropic-beta: fast-mode-2026-02-01` header | `"speed": "fast"` in body |

`response.usage.speed` reports the speed used. Fast mode has its own rate limit; on 429, retry after `retry-after` or drop `speed` to fall back to standard (switching speed invalidates prompt cache). Not available with Batch API, Priority Tier, Claude Platform on AWS, or third-party platforms.

---

## Task Budgets (Quick Reference)

**Beta, Opus 4.7.** Gives Claude a token ceiling for an agentic loop so it paces itself and finishes gracefully instead of being cut off. Set `task_budget` inside `output_config` on `client.beta.messages.stream(...)` with beta flag `task-budgets-2026-03-13` — stream so the large `max_tokens` doesn't hit HTTP timeouts:

```python
with client.beta.messages.stream(
    model="claude-opus-4-7", max_tokens=128000,
    output_config={"effort": "high", "task_budget": {"type": "tokens", "total": 64000}},
    betas=["task-budgets-2026-03-13"],
    messages=[...], tools=[...],
) as stream:
    response = stream.get_final_message()
```

`task_budget` fields: `type` (always `"tokens"`), `total`, and optional `remaining` (defaults to `total`). The countdown counts what Claude generates plus the tool results it reads this turn — **not** the full history you resend each request. Leave `remaining` unset in the normal loop; **only pass `remaining`** when you compact or rewrite history between requests and the server can no longer derive prior spend.

---

## Provider Clients (Quick Reference)

When targeting Claude on a third-party platform, use that platform's dedicated client class — not the first-party `Anthropic()` client with a `base_url` override. After construction the client exposes the same `messages.create` / `.stream` surface.

### Amazon Bedrock

Use the **Mantle** client (Messages-API Bedrock endpoint). Bedrock model IDs take an `anthropic.` prefix (e.g. `"anthropic.{{OPUS_ID}}"`). Region required.

| Language | Client |
|---|---|
| Python | `from anthropic import AnthropicBedrockMantle` → `AnthropicBedrockMantle(aws_region="…")` |
| TypeScript | `import { AnthropicBedrockMantle } from "@anthropic-ai/bedrock-sdk"` → `new AnthropicBedrockMantle({ awsRegion: "…" })` |
| Go | `bedrock.NewMantleClient(ctx, bedrock.MantleClientConfig{ AWSRegion: "…" })` |
| Java | `AnthropicOkHttpClient.builder().backend(BedrockMantleBackend.fromEnv()).build()` (`com.anthropic.bedrock.backends`) |
| C# | `new AnthropicBedrockMantleClient(new() { AwsRegion = "…" })` (package `Anthropic.Bedrock`) |
| PHP | `use Anthropic\Bedrock\MantleClient;` → `new MantleClient(awsRegion: '…')` |
| Ruby | `Anthropic::BedrockMantleClient.new(aws_region: "…")` |

`AnthropicBedrock` / `BedrockClient` / `BedrockBackend` (without `Mantle`) are the legacy `bedrock-runtime` InvokeModel path — prefer the Mantle client for new code.

### Microsoft Foundry

| Language | Client |
|---|---|
| Python | `from anthropic import AnthropicFoundry` → `AnthropicFoundry(api_key=…, resource="…")` |
| TypeScript | `import AnthropicFoundry from "@anthropic-ai/foundry-sdk"` → `new AnthropicFoundry({ … })` |
| Java | `AnthropicOkHttpClient.builder().backend(FoundryBackend.fromEnv()).build()` (`com.anthropic.foundry.backends`) |
| C# | `new AnthropicFoundryClient(new AnthropicFoundryApiKeyCredentials(…))` (package `Anthropic.Foundry`) |
| PHP | `Foundry\Client::withCredentials(…)` |

Go and Ruby don't support Foundry. For Ruby, fall back to `Anthropic::Client.new(base_url: "<foundry endpoint>")` (Entra ID auth not built in).

### Google Cloud Vertex AI

Two required constructor args: GCP `project_id` and `region`. Vertex model IDs take **no prefix** — current-generation models (Opus 4.7/4.6, Sonnet 4.6) use the bare first-party ID (e.g. `"{{OPUS_ID}}"`); dated-snapshot models use an `@` version separator (e.g. `claude-opus-4-5@20251101`, **not** `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`). Auth is GCP ADC (`gcloud auth application-default login`); no Anthropic API key. `region` can be `"global"` (recommended), a multi-region (`"us"`/`"eu"`), or a specific region.

| Language | Client |
|---|---|
| Python | `from anthropic import AnthropicVertex` → `AnthropicVertex(project_id="…", region="…")` (install `"anthropic[vertex]"`) |
| TypeScript | `import { AnthropicVertex } from "@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk"` → `new AnthropicVertex({ projectId, region })` |
| Go | `import "github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go/vertex"` → `anthropic.NewClient(vertex.WithGoogleAuth(ctx, region, projectID))` |
| Java | `AnthropicOkHttpClient.builder().backend(VertexBackend.builder().region("…").project("…").build()).build()` (`com.anthropic.vertex.backends`) |
| C# | `new AnthropicClient { Backend = new VertexBackend(projectId, region) }` (package `Anthropic.Vertex`) |
| PHP | `use Anthropic\Vertex;` → `Vertex\Client::fromEnvironment(location: '…', projectId: '…')` — note `location`, not `region` |
| Ruby | `Anthropic::VertexClient.new(region: "…", project_id: "…")` |

---

## Context Editing (Quick Reference)

**Beta.** Context editing **clears** old tool results or thinking blocks before the model sees them; it is **not compaction** (which summarizes). On `client.beta.messages.*` with beta `context-management-2025-06-27`, pass `context_management.edits` with a strategy type:

```python
client.beta.messages.create(
    model="{{OPUS_ID}}", max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["context-management-2025-06-27"],
    context_management={"edits": [{"type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919"}]},
    tools=[...], messages=[...],
)
```

Strategy types: `clear_tool_uses_20250919` (clears old tool results; optional `clear_tool_inputs: true` also clears the tool_use params) and `clear_thinking_20251015` (clears thinking blocks). Do **not** use `compact_20260112` / beta `compact-2026-01-12` — those are the separate compaction feature.

## Mid-Conversation System Messages (Quick Reference)

**{{OPUS_NAME}} only; no beta header.** Append `{"role": "system", "content": "…"}` to the `messages` array (not the top-level `system` field) to add an operator instruction mid-conversation without invalidating the cached prefix. Use the regular `client.messages.create`. A mid-conversation system message must follow a `user` message (or an `assistant` message ending in server-tool use), and must be either the last entry in `messages` or be followed by an `assistant` turn — it cannot be `messages[0]`. Availability: `shared/platform-availability.md`. See `shared/prompt-caching.md` § Mid-conversation system messages.

---

## Managed Agents (Beta)

A third surface: server-managed stateful agents with Anthropic-hosted tool execution. Create a persisted, versioned Agent config (`POST /v1/agents`), then start Sessions that reference it. Each session provisions a container as the agent's workspace — bash, file ops, code execution run there; the agent loop runs on Anthropic's orchestration layer and acts on the container via tools. The session streams events; you send messages and tool results back.

Availability: `shared/platform-availability.md`. For agents on Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry (where Managed Agents is unsupported), use Claude API + tool use.

**Mandatory flow:** Agent (once) → Session (every run). `model`/`system`/`tools` live on the agent, never the session. See `shared/managed-agents-overview.md` for the full reading guide, beta headers, and pitfalls.

**Beta headers:** `managed-agents-2026-04-01` — the SDK sets this automatically for all `client.beta.{agents,environments,sessions,vaults,memory_stores,deployments,deployment_runs}.*` calls. Skills API uses `skills-2025-10-02` and Files API uses `files-api-2025-04-14`, passed automatically except for `/v1/skills` and `/v1/files`.

**Subcommands** — invoke with `/claude-api <subcommand>`:

| Subcommand | Action |
|---|---|
| `managed-agents-onboard` | Walk the user through setting up a Managed Agent from scratch. Read `shared/managed-agents-onboarding.md` and run its interview script: **describe → configure the agent (propose, don't interrogate) → environment → session**, with a silent viability gate (job vs tools/credentials/data) before any code is emitted. Run the interview, don't summarize. |

**Reading guide:** start with `shared/managed-agents-overview.md`, then the topical `shared/managed-agents-*.md` files (core, environments, tools, events, outcomes, multiagent, webhooks, memory, scheduled-deployments, client-patterns, onboarding, api-reference). For Python, TypeScript, Go, Ruby, PHP, and Java read `{lang}/managed-agents/README.md`; for cURL read `curl/managed-agents.md`. **Agents are persistent — create once, reference by ID.** Store the agent ID returned by `agents.create` and pass it to every subsequent `sessions.create`; don't call `agents.create` in the request path. The Anthropic CLI (`ant`) creates agents and environments from version-controlled YAML — see `shared/anthropic-cli.md`. If a binding isn't shown in the README, WebFetch the relevant entry from `shared/live-sources.md`. C# uses `client.Beta.Agents`.

**When the user wants to set up a Managed Agent from scratch** ("how do I get started", "walk me through creating one", "set up a new agent"): read `shared/managed-agents-onboarding.md` and run its interview — same flow as `managed-agents-onboard`.

**When the user asks "how do I write the client code for X":** read `shared/managed-agents-client-patterns.md` — lossless stream reconnect, `processed_at` queued/processed gate, interrupt, `tool_confirmation` round-trip, the idle/terminated break gate, post-idle status race, stream-first ordering, file-mount gotchas, keeping credentials host-side via custom tools, etc.

**When the user wants the agent to run on a schedule** (cron, "every night", "weekly report"): read `shared/managed-agents-scheduled-deployments.md` — deployments fire sessions autonomously on a cron cadence, with per-firing run records and lifecycle controls (pause/unpause/archive).

---

## Server Tools (Quick Reference)

Server-side tools run on Anthropic's infrastructure — no client-side execution loop. Declare in `tools`; results arrive as content blocks in the same response. **No beta header** unless noted. **Prefer the latest type variant your model supports.** The `_20260209` web search / web fetch variants below (dynamic filtering) require Opus 4.7/4.6 or Sonnet 4.6; the basic variants for older models are listed after the table.

| Tool | `type` | `name` | Key optional params | Result block type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Web search | `web_search_20260209` | `web_search` | `max_uses`, `allowed_domains`/`blocked_domains`, `user_location` | `web_search_tool_result` → `.content` is a list of `web_search_result` |
| Web fetch | `web_fetch_20260209` | `web_fetch` | `max_uses`, `allowed_domains`/`blocked_domains`, `citations`, `max_content_tokens` | `web_fetch_tool_result` → `.content` is a `web_fetch_result` with a `document` block |
| Code execution | `code_execution_20260521` | `code_execution` | none | `bash_code_execution_tool_result` → `.content.stdout` / `.stderr` / `.return_code` |
| Tool search (regex) | `tool_search_tool_regex_20251119` | `tool_search_tool_regex` | mark other tools `defer_loading: true` | `tool_search_tool_result` |
| Tool search (BM25) | `tool_search_tool_bm25_20251119` | `tool_search_tool_bm25` | mark other tools `defer_loading: true` | `tool_search_tool_result` |

`web_search_20260209` / `web_fetch_20260209` have built-in dynamic filtering — code execution runs under the hood, so do **not** separately declare `code_execution` in `tools`. For models older than Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6, use the basic variants `web_search_20250305` / `web_fetch_20250910`; on Vertex AI only basic `web_search_20250305` is available. `code_execution_20260120` (REPL persistence + programmatic tool calling) runs on Opus 4.5+ / Sonnet 4.5+. **Go SDK only**: `code_execution_20260521` lives under `client.Beta.Messages.New` with `Betas: []anthropic.AnthropicBeta{"code-execution-2025-08-25"}` (other languages use plain `client.messages.create`); `code_execution_20260120` uses non-beta `client.Messages.New` in Go like everywhere else. Web fetch only fetches URLs already present in the conversation. Provider availability varies — see `shared/platform-availability.md`. See `shared/tool-use-concepts.md` for `pause_turn` handling.

## Document & File Input (Quick Reference)

**PDF (base64, no beta):** `{"type": "document", "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": "application/pdf", "data": <b64 string>}}` in user content, before the text block. Base64 string must have no newlines. Limits: 32 MB request, 600 pages (100 for 200k-context models). Java: `ContentBlockParam.ofDocument(DocumentBlockParam... Base64PdfSource.builder().data(...))`.

**Files API (beta `files-api-2025-04-14`):** upload via `client.beta.files.upload(...)` → response `id` is the `file_id`. Reference it as `{"type": "document", "source": {"type": "file", "file_id": "..."}}` for PDF/text, or `{"type": "image", ...}` for images — the content-block type must match the file's MIME type. The beta header is required on **both** the upload and the `messages.create` that references the file.

**Citations (no beta):** set `citations: {enabled: true}` on each `document` content block (all or none). Response splits into multiple `text` blocks; cited blocks carry a `citations` array. Each citation has `cited_text`, `document_index`, `document_title`, and a location by `type`: `char_location` (`start_char_index`/`end_char_index`) for plain text, `page_location` (`start_page_number`/`end_page_number`, 1-indexed) for PDF, `content_block_location` for custom content. Incompatible with `output_config.format`.

## Tool Use Patterns (Quick Reference)

**Strict tool use (no beta):** set `strict: true` as a top-level field on the tool definition (alongside `name`/`description`/`input_schema`), **not** on `tool_choice`. Schema must have `additionalProperties: false` + `required`. Guarantees `tool_use.input` validates exactly. Go: `Strict: anthropic.Bool(true)` + `additionalProperties` via `InputSchema.ExtraFields`; Java: `.strict(true)` + `.putAdditionalProperty("additionalProperties", JsonValue.from(false))`.

**Parallel tool use (default on):** one assistant message may contain multiple `tool_use` blocks. Execute them concurrently, then return **all** `tool_result` blocks in a **single** user message (don't split across messages). For a failed tool, return `tool_result` with `is_error: true` — don't drop it.

**Tool Runner (SDK beta helper):** drives the tool-call loop via `client.beta.messages.*`. Python: `@beta_tool` + `client.beta.messages.tool_runner(...)` → `runner.until_done()`. TypeScript: `betaZodTool({...})` from `@anthropic-ai/sdk/helpers/beta/zod` + `client.beta.messages.toolRunner(...)` → `await runner`. Go: `toolrunner.NewBetaToolFromJSONSchema(...)` + `client.Beta.Messages.NewToolRunner(...)` → `.RunToCompletion(ctx)`. Java requires `.addBeta("structured-outputs-2025-11-13")`. Ruby: `Anthropic::BaseTool` subclass + `client.beta.messages.tool_runner(...)`. PHP: `BetaRunnableTool` + `->toolRunner(...)`. C#: raw JSON-schema tools + `BetaToolRunner` via `client.Beta.Messages.ToolRunner(...)`.

**Programmatic tool calling (no beta header):** Claude calls your custom tool from inside code execution. Add `{"type": "code_execution_20260120", "name": "code_execution"}` **and** set `"allowed_callers": ["code_execution_20260120"]` on your custom tool. Opus 4.5+ / Sonnet 4.5+. When responding to a pending programmatic call, the user message must contain **only** `tool_result` blocks (no text). Not compatible with `strict: true`, `disable_parallel_tool_use`, forced `tool_choice`, or MCP tools.

## Other API Surfaces (Quick Reference)

**Message Batches (no beta):** `client.messages.batches.create(requests=[{custom_id, params}, ...])` → poll `.retrieve(id).processing_status` until `"ended"` → stream `.results(id)`. Each result has `.custom_id` + `.result.type` (`succeeded`/`errored`/`canceled`/`expired`); on success read `.result.message.content`. Python wraps requests as `Request(custom_id=..., params=MessageCreateParamsNonStreaming(...))`. Results arrive in **any order** — key by `custom_id`, never by position.

**Models API (no beta):** `client.models.list()` (auto-paginates) and `client.models.retrieve("{{OPUS_ID}}")`. Each model object has `id`, `display_name`, `created_at`, and — since Mar 2026 — `max_input_tokens` (the context window), `max_tokens` (output cap), and `capabilities`. There is no `context_window` field.

**Stop details (GA, Opus 4.7+):** `response.stop_details` is populated **only when `stop_reason == "refusal"`** (fields: `type: "refusal"`, `category: "cyber"|"bio"|null`, `explanation`). It is `null` for every other `stop_reason` — always guard before reading.

**Client config (no beta):** `timeout` default 10 min; **units differ by SDK** — Python/Ruby: seconds; TypeScript: **milliseconds**; Go `option.WithRequestTimeout(time.Duration)`; Java `Duration`; C# `TimeSpan`. `max_retries`/`maxRetries` default 2 (retries 408/409/429/5xx + connection errors). `base_url` (or `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env). Per-request override: Python `client.with_options(timeout=5.0).messages.create(...)`; TS `client.messages.create({...}, {timeout: 5_000})`. Timeouts are retried — wall-clock can reach `timeout × (max_retries+1)`.

## Workload Identity Federation (Quick Reference)

**GA, no beta header.** Construct the normal zero-arg client (`Anthropic()` / `new Anthropic()` / `anthropic.NewClient()` / `AnthropicOkHttpClient.fromEnv()`); the SDK auto-detects WIF when **all** of `ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID`, and `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` (or `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN`) are set, exchanges the JWT at `/v1/oauth/token`, and auto-refreshes. `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID` doesn't gate activation — required only when the federation rule spans multiple workspaces. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (even empty) outrank WIF, and a set `ANTHROPIC_PROFILE` also wins — `unset` all three, don't blank them.

## When to Use WebFetch

Use WebFetch for the latest documentation when the user asks for "latest"/"current" info, cached data seems incorrect, or they ask about features not covered here. Live URLs are in `shared/live-sources.md`.

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't truncate inputs when passing files or content. If content exceeds the context window, notify the user and discuss options (chunking, summarization) rather than silently truncating.
- **Opus 4.7 thinking:** adaptive only. `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` returns 400 — `budget_tokens` is fully removed (with `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`). Use `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`. (Newer models keep this surface; the thinking-always-on tier additionally rejects an explicit `{type: "disabled"}` — omit the param. See the migration guide.)
- **Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 thinking:** use `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` — don't use `budget_tokens` for new code (deprecated on both; the transitional escape hatch in `shared/model-migration.md` doesn't apply to 4.7). For older models, `budget_tokens` < `max_tokens` (minimum 1024), or it errors.
- **Prefill removed (4.6/4.7 family):** last-assistant-turn prefills return 400 on Opus 4.6/4.7 and Sonnet 4.6. Use structured outputs (`output_config.format`) or system-prompt instructions to control format.
- **Confirm migration scope before editing:** when asked to migrate without a named file/directory/list, ask which scope first (whole working dir, a subdirectory, or specific files). Don't edit until confirmed. "migrate my codebase", "upgrade to Sonnet 4.6", bare "migrate to Opus 4.7" are still ambiguous — they say what, not where. Proceed without asking only when an exact file/directory/list is named. See `shared/model-migration.md` Step 0.
- **`max_tokens` defaults:** don't lowball it — hitting the cap truncates mid-thought. Non-streaming: default `~16000` (under SDK HTTP timeouts). Streaming: default `~64000`. Go lower only with a reason: classification (`~256`), cost caps, deliberately short outputs, or `max_tokens: 0` for cache pre-warming (see `shared/prompt-caching.md` → Pre-warming).
- **128K output tokens:** Opus 4.6/4.7 support up to 128K `max_tokens`, but the SDKs require streaming for values that large. Use `.stream()` with `.get_final_message()` / `.finalMessage()`.
- **Tool call JSON parsing (4.6/4.7 family):** these may produce different JSON string escaping in tool-call `input` (Unicode, forward-slash). Always parse with `json.loads()` / `JSON.parse()` — never raw string matching on the serialized input.
- **Structured outputs (all models):** use `output_config: {format: {...}}`, not the deprecated `output_format` parameter on `messages.create()`.
- **Error handling — catch a chain, not one broad class.** A single `except APIStatusError` / `catch (AnthropicServiceException)` / `rescue APIError` loses the retryable (429, ≥500, network) vs non-retryable (400/404) distinction. Write a most-specific-first chain (e.g. `NotFoundError` → `RateLimitError` → `APIStatusError` → `APIConnectionError`; Go: `errors.As` into `*anthropic.Error` then `switch apierr.StatusCode`). Class names in `shared/error-codes.md`.
- **Don't research SDK types — write first.** If a type name isn't in the included docs, write the file from the namespace/package tables and let the compiler point you to the right name. A quick `strings` / `jar tf` / `javap` on the installed SDK is fine for locating names; don't escalate to WebFetch/clones/reflection programs before writing.
- **Don't reimplement SDK functionality:** use `stream.finalMessage()` instead of wrapping `.on()` events in `new Promise()`; use typed exception classes (`Anthropic.RateLimitError`, etc.) instead of string-matching errors; use SDK types (`Anthropic.MessageParam`, `Anthropic.Tool`, `Anthropic.Message`, etc.) instead of redefining interfaces.
- **Bash and text editor tools are Anthropic-defined, schema-less.** Declare `{"type": "bash_20250124", "name": "bash"}` / `{"type": "text_editor_20250728", "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool"}` — no `input_schema`. A custom tool named `"bash"` with your own schema is a different tool. Handlers in `shared/tool-use-concepts.md` § Client-Side Tools.
- **Advisor tool model pairing.** The advisor's `model` must be at least as capable as the request's top-level `model` (e.g. executor `claude-sonnet-4-6` → advisor `claude-opus-4-7`). An invalid pair returns 400. Pairing table in `shared/tool-use-concepts.md` § Advisor.
- **Agent Skills ≠ Managed Agents.** To have Claude generate a `.pptx`/`.xlsx`/etc. via Agent Skills, call `client.beta.messages.create` with `container={"skills": [...]}`, the `code_execution_20260521` tool, and both `code-execution-2025-08-25` + `skills-2025-10-02` betas. Don't use `client.beta.agents`/`sessions`/`environments` — that's the Managed Agents surface.
- **MCP connector needs both halves.** `mcp_servers=[{type:"url", url, name}]` alone is rejected — also add `tools=[{type:"mcp_toolset", mcp_server_name:<same name>}]` with beta `mcp-client-2025-11-20`.
- **Context editing ≠ compaction.** Context editing *clears* tool results/thinking blocks; compaction *summarizes* history. For context editing use `context_management.edits` with `clear_tool_uses_20250919` (or `clear_thinking_20251015`) on `client.beta.messages.*` with beta `context-management-2025-06-27` — not `compact_20260112` / beta `compact-2026-01-12`.
- **`inference_geo` is a direct top-level parameter** — `client.messages.create(..., inference_geo="us")` / `.inferenceGeo("us")`. Not in `extra_body`. Supported on Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 and later. `response.usage.inference_geo` reports where inference ran.
- **Fine-grained tool streaming is not a beta feature.** Set `eager_input_streaming: true` on the tool definition and call the regular `client.messages.stream(...)` — no beta header, no `client.beta.*`.
- **Memory tool type is `memory_20250818`.** Declare `{"type": "memory_20250818", "name": "memory"}`. Go uses the beta-namespace type on `client.Beta.Messages.New`; Python/TypeScript/Ruby/PHP/C# use non-beta `client.messages.create`. Python/TypeScript provide `BetaAbstractMemoryTool` / `betaMemoryTool` helpers for the backend.
- **Use a model the feature actually supports.** Fast mode is Opus 4.6/4.7 (both deprecated; Opus 4.8 is the durable tier — do **not** auto-substitute, leave the caller's fast-mode model string in place and flag the deprecation); task budgets are Opus 4.7; the advisor tool requires a valid executor↔advisor pair. If the user names a model the feature doesn't support, use a supported model and note the substitution.
- **Bedrock / Foundry: use the platform client class.** Bedrock → the `…BedrockMantle…` client with `anthropic.`-prefixed model IDs (`AnthropicBedrock`/`BedrockBackend` without `Mantle` is the legacy path). Foundry → `AnthropicFoundry`/`FoundryBackend`/`AnthropicFoundryClient` (C#, Java, PHP, Python, TypeScript); Go and Ruby have no Foundry client — Ruby falls back to the first-party client with a custom `base_url`. Per-language table above.
- **Don't define custom types for SDK data structures:** use `Anthropic.MessageParam` for messages, `Anthropic.Tool` for tool definitions, `Anthropic.ToolUseBlock` / `Anthropic.ToolResultBlockParam` for tool results, `Anthropic.Message` for responses. A hand-rolled `interface ChatMessage` duplicates the SDK and loses type safety.
- **Report and document output:** for reports/documents/visualizations, the code execution sandbox has `python-docx`, `python-pptx`, `matplotlib`, `pillow`, and `pypdf` pre-installed. Claude can generate formatted files (DOCX, PDF, charts) and return them via the Files API — prefer this over plain stdout text for "report"/"document" requests.
- **Server-tool errors don't raise.** Web search/fetch errors return HTTP 200 with a `*_tool_result` block whose `content` is a single error object (e.g. `{error_code: "max_uses_exceeded"}`) — not an exception. A success `content` is a *list*; an error `content` is an *object* — branch on that before indexing.
- **Code execution output block type:** `code_execution_20260521` returns `bash_code_execution_tool_result` (with `.content.stdout`), not the legacy bare `code_execution_tool_result`. Match on the correct type.
- **Tool search: never defer everything.** The search tool itself must not have `defer_loading: true`, and at least one tool in `tools` must be non-deferred, or the API returns 400 `All tools have defer_loading set`.
- **`strict: true` goes on the tool, not `tool_choice`.** It's a sibling of `name`/`description`/`input_schema` on the tool definition.
- **Parallel tool results go in ONE user message.** Splitting `tool_result` blocks across multiple user messages silently trains Claude to stop making parallel calls.
- **Citations + structured outputs are incompatible.** `citations: {enabled: true}` on a document while also setting `output_config.format` returns 400.
- **Batch results are unordered.** Match by `custom_id`, never by position.
- **Vertex model IDs have no prefix.** Unlike Bedrock's `anthropic.`-prefixed IDs, Vertex takes the bare first-party ID for current-generation models (e.g. `"{{OPUS_ID}}"`); dated-snapshot models use an `@` separator (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`).
- **`stop_details` is `null` unless `stop_reason == "refusal"`.** For `max_tokens`, `end_turn`, etc. it's `null` — guard before reading `.category`.
- **WIF auth: unset `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `ANTHROPIC_PROFILE`.** All three outrank Workload Identity Federation in the SDK's precedence chain (even set to `""`) and silently win. `unset` them, don't blank them.
